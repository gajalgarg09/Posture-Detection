# Posture-Detection
This project demonstrates real-time human pose detection using PoseNet from ml5.js and the p5.js library. It uses a webcam feed to detect keypoints and skeleton connections and visualizes them on a canvas.

# Features
Real-Time Pose Detection: Detects body keypoints and skeletons using PoseNet.
Visualization:
Red circles represent keypoints (e.g., joints).
White lines connect keypoints to form a skeleton.
Optimized for Performance: Adjustable video resolution and confidence thresholds.

# Technologies Used
PoseNet (ml5.js): For pose detection.
p5.js: For rendering the video and pose visualization.
